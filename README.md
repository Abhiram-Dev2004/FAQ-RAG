## Overview

RAGworks is a production-ready document Q&A system that combines PDF processing, vector search, and Large Language Models to provide accurate, context-aware answers. Built with enterprise-grade security and multi-tenant architecture, it's ideal for knowledge bases, internal documentation, and AI-powered customer support.

**Key Differentiator:** Namespace-based vector storage using Pinecone ensures complete data isolation between users and document sets, preventing information leakage while maintaining high retrieval accuracy.

## Features

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- JWT-based user authentication
- User credential storage with SQLAlchemy
- Protected API endpoints
- Session management with token-based access control

### 📄 PDF Document Processing
- Upload PDFs up to 10MB
- Automatic text extraction and chunking
- Mistral-powered embedding generation
- Persistent knowledge base storage in Pinecone

### 🧠 Intelligent Retrieval
- **Namespace isolation** - Each user/document set gets a dedicated Pinecone namespace
- Semantic search using Mistral embeddings
- Context-aware answer generation with Mistral LLM
- Reduced hallucinations through grounded retrieval

### 💻 Modern Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication
- **AI/ML:** Mistral AI (LLM + Embeddings)
- **Vector Database:** Pinecone (namespace-based storage)
- **User Database:** SQLAlchemy
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Frontend), Cloud hosting (Backend)

## Why Namespace-Based Retrieval?

Traditional RAG systems store all embeddings in a shared space, leading to:

- ❌ Irrelevant context from other users' documents
- ❌ Privacy and data leakage concerns
- ❌ Reduced accuracy in multi-tenant environments

**RAGworks Solution with Pinecone Namespaces:**

- ✅ Dedicated namespace per user/document set
- ✅ Complete data isolation at the vector database level
- ✅ Higher precision retrieval with no cross-contamination
- ✅ Scalable multi-tenant architecture
- ✅ Efficient resource utilization
